# TODO

- [x] Add error handling to the SQL query in `Professor/archive.php`.

- [x] Verify that the `professor_id` session variable is correctly set when a professor logs in.

- [ ] Check the `subjects` table in the database to see if there are any subjects with `status = 'archived'` for the professor.
- [x] Inspect `archive_details.php` to see if it depends on any other variables or session values.

- [x] Test the archive functionality after implementing the changes.
