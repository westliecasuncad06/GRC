# Mobile View Click Issue Fix - My Classes Page

## Problem Summary
Users were unable to click elements on the mobile view of `https://grc.gt.tc/Student/my_classes.php`. Elements were clickable on desktop but not on mobile devices.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Z-Index Stacking Issues**
- Bottom navigation sidebar: `z-index: 1010`
- Navigation items: `z-index: 1020`
- Modals: `z-index: 1000` (LOWER than sidebar!)
- Result: Sidebar was overlapping and blocking modal interactions

### 2. **Pointer Events Not Explicitly Set**
- Elements didn't have `pointer-events: auto` explicitly set
- Some parent containers might have had `pointer-events: none`
- Touch actions weren't optimized for mobile

### 3. **Touch Target Size Issues**
- Buttons were smaller than the recommended 48x48px minimum
- Insufficient padding made tapping difficult on mobile

### 4. **Viewport Configuration**
- Original: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`
- Missing maximum-scale and user-scalable parameters

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Viewport Meta Tag
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, user-scalable=yes" />
```
- Allows users to zoom if needed
- Prevents iOS Safari from auto-zooming on input fields

### 2. Fixed Z-Index Hierarchy
```css
/* Modals now have the highest z-index */
.modal { z-index: 9999 !important; }
.modal-content { z-index: 10000; }
.toast-container { z-index: 10001; }
```

### 3. Added Explicit Pointer Events
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .main-content { pointer-events: auto !important; }
    button, a, input, .btn, .class-card { pointer-events: auto !important; }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Touch Handling
```css
.btn {
    touch-action: manipulation;
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(247, 82, 112, 0.2);
    user-select: none;
    -webkit-user-select: none;
}
```

### 5. Proper Button Sizing for Mobile
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .btn {
        min-height: 48px;
        min-width: 48px;
        padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
    }
}
```

### 6. Added JavaScript Debugging
- Console logging to identify clicked elements
- Runtime pointer-events enablement for all interactive elements
- Can be removed in production if not needed

### 7. Modal Backdrop Click Handlers
```javascript
document.getElementById('enrollModal').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (e.target === this) closeEnrollModal();
});
```

### 8. Overflow and Positioning Fixes
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    html, body {
        overflow-x: hidden;
        width: 100%;
        position: relative;
    }
    
    .main-content {
        margin-left: 0 !important;
        width: 100% !important;
        padding-bottom: 200px; /* Space for footbar and bottom nav */
    }
}
```
