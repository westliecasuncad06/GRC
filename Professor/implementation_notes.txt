The implementation has been added to your PHP file, but to ensure it works correctly, please verify the following:

1. CSS styles are already included in your file
2. The following data variables are properly set up:
   - $subjects
   - $attendance_stats
   - $recent_dates

The enhanced stat cards should now be displaying with:
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to mobile screens
- Clean visualization of attendance statistics
- Interactive buttons for viewing attendance details
- Empty state handling when no data is available

Each card shows:
1. Subject name and class code
2. Overall attendance rate
3. Breakdown of attendance statuses (Present, Absent, Late, Excused)
4. Recent sessions with view buttons
5. Empty state with call-to-action when no records exist

The mobile view (300-420px) features:
- Single column layout
- Optimized spacing and padding
- Readable font sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons
- No overflow issues

Would you like me to help you verify any specific part of the implementation or make additional adjustments to the styles?
