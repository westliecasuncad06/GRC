#### 3. Excused (E)

**[INSERT SCREENSHOT: Excused status indicator]**

- **Meaning:** Absent but with valid excuse
- **Color:** Yellow/Orange

- **Percentage:** May or may not affect attendance rate
- **Common Reasons:**

*Depends on institution policy whether Excused counts

**Example:**
- Total Classes: 20
- Present: 16
- Absent: 2
- Excused: 1
- Late: 1

If Excused counts as Present:
```
Attendance % = (16 + 1 + 1) / 20 × 100% = 90%
```
